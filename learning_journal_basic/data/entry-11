<h2>Day 11</h2>
<p>Well, on the bright side, we're not dealing with sockets anymore! Dealing with pyramid and heroku is a mess at first when we try to cram so much stuff into one day (or week for that matter), but unlike with the websockets, I feel confident that I will become familiar with the frameworks over time. Unfortunately, the tasks I find least appealing about programming are the ones that tend to drag themselves out the longest, which is nothing new, but it kind of sucks to be done with the deque so early in the day, because I really enjoy working on those assignments. Still though, this week feels like it's going to cover a ton of applicable skills for programming jobs, so I'm excited, albeit a little worn out.</p>
